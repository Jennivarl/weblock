"""
Workaround for a genuine Windows-compatibility bug in gltest's direct
execution mode (gltest.direct.loader._inject_message_to_fd0,
genlayer-test 0.29.2): it does tempfile.mkstemp() -> os.dup2(fd, 0) ->
os.unlink(path) while fd 0 still holds the file open via the dup2'd
handle. That's legal on POSIX (files can be unlinked while open) but
raises "[WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is
being used by another process" on Windows.

This is not our contract's bug -- it's in third-party site-packages we
don't want to hand-edit (wouldn't survive a reinstall/upgrade). Patched
here instead: same logic, minus the unlink. The temp file is a few bytes
of encoded message data; leaving it behind for the OS to reap later is a
harmless trade-off for being able to run tests on Windows at all.

Unlike glsim's server mode, direct_deploy/direct_vm run everything
in-process within this pytest session, so a conftest.py monkeypatch here
actually takes effect (glsim's server-process mode needed a separate
launcher patch instead -- see the greybox project's history for that
version of this same fix).
